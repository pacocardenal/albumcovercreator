# ``ChristmasSongCreator``

Create album covers for this christmas season. Maybe you can generate the next holiday hit.

## Overview

ChristmasSongCreator provides models and utilities for create, modify, and view album covers. The framework provides structures to model an individual ``AlbumCover``, and identify them by key characteristics, including their ``AlbumCover/title`` and cool ``AlbumCover/background-swift.property``. You can create your own custom album covers using a ``AlbumCoverGenerator``, and name them using a ``TitleGenerator``.

You can visualize and observe your album covers by adding a ``AlbumCoverView`` to a SwiftUI view structure.
Also, you can represent the title only using a ``TextOverlayView``.
